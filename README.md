## An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns for my client Louise
Initially, I added five new data columns
* Percentage Funded
* Average Donation
* Split Category/Subcategory into
* * Parent Category
* * Subcategory
* Converted the two Unix timestamp columns to two standard date format
---
I created a pivot table that compaired outcomes via the parent category. I added country as a filter
I created two charts:  one that included all countries; another that displayed the outcomes for the United States only.
The charts show that US outcomes are similar to all countries outcomes.  
---
I created a separate pivot table that compaired outcomes to subcategory with country and parent category as filters.  
I did not gain any additional insights with this information.  
---
Created a new pivot table comparing outcomes to launch date with parent category as a filter.  
* Campaigns launched in May saw the greatest success.
* Campaigns launched in January, June, July, and October had similar failure numbers.  
* The line depticting canceled campaigns was close to linear or flat.

Documents created for Louise's play FEVER
## An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns for my client Louise
Initially, I added five new data columns
* Percentage Funded
* Average Donation
* Split Category/Subcategory into
* * Parent Category
* * Subcategory
* Converted the two Unix timestamp columns to two standard date format
---
I created a pivot table that compaired outcomes via the parent category. I added country as a filter
I created two charts:  one that included all countries; another that displayed the outcomes for the United States only.
The charts show that US outcomes are similar to all countries outcomes.  
---
I created a separate pivot table that compaired outcomes to subcategory with country and parent category as filters.  
I did not gain any additional insights with this information.  
---
Created a new pivot table comparing outcomes to launch date with parent category as a filter. 
Graphed the data and observed the following:  
* Campaigns launched in May saw the greatest success.
* Campaigns launched in January, June, July, and October had similar failure numbers.  
* The line depticting canceled campaigns was close to linear or flat.  
I then filtered the pivot table by the parent category of Theater. 
Graphed this data and made the following observations:
* The most successful theater campaigns launched in May.  
* Theater campaigns that launched in May, July, and October had the highest failure.  
* Like the all parent campaigns data, canceled campaigns was somewhat linear.

My client was inspired by five plays she saw at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe and wanted information as to how they were funded.  
Created a separate sheet titled "Edinburgh Research."  
* All five were successful
* The average goal was around $2000.00, average pledge amount was $2300.00, average donation was $40 from an average of 62 backers.  
---
To aid my client, I filtered the Kickstarter data, creating two separate worksheets
* Successful US Kickstarters
* Failed US kickstarters
From these spreadsheets, I ran a statistical analysis finding mean, median, standard devision, upper and lower quartile, and IQR.

Louise mentioned that she hopes to produce a musical in Great Britain.  I filtered the data by Great Britain and musicals.  I then selected pledged and goal categories and performed a statistical analysis.  Data from the statistical analysis was ploted and presented to Louise.  From this plot, the mean campaign goal was around $4,000. This is outside the outliers range for the amount pledged.  I recommended that Louise try to get her play produced for less than $4,000.  Additionally, half of the campaign goals were less than $2,000, which is slightly larger than the 3rd quartile for pledged amounts.

Documents created for Louise's play FEVER
## An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns for my client Louise
Initially, I added five new data columns
* Percentage Funded
* Average Donation
* Split Category/Subcategory into
* * Parent Category
* * Subcategory
* Converted the two Unix timestamp columns to two standard date format
---
I created a pivot table that compaired outcomes via the parent category. I added country as a filter
I created two charts:  one that included all countries; another that displayed the outcomes for the United States only.
The charts show that US outcomes are similar to all countries outcomes.
